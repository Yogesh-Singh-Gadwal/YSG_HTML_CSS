<p class="one">Tendulkar introduction.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman.
Tendulkar was born at Nirmal Nursing Home in Dadar,
 Bombay on 24 April 1973[citation needed] to a Rajapur Saraswat Brahmin family.[24]
 His father, Ramesh Tendulkar, was a well-known Marathi novelist and his mother, Rajni, worked in the insurance industry.
 [25] Ramesh named Tendulkar after his favourite music director, Sachin Dev Burman. 
 Tendulkar has three elder siblings: two half-brothers Nitin and Ajit, and a half-sister Savita. 
 They were Ramesh's children from his first marriage.[citation needed]

Tendulkar played as a youngster with his brother, Ajit, for Sahitya Sahawas societyâ€™s cricket team at Bandra East.
 Ajit is credited by Sachin for playing a pivotal role in his life.[26]
 Ramakant Achrekar was impressed with Tendulkar's talent and advised him to shift his schooling to Sharadashram Vidyamandir (English)
 High School,[1] a school at Dadar which had a dominant cricket team and had produced many notable cricketers.
 Prior to this, Tendulkar had attended the Indian Education Society's New English School in Bandra (East).[27]
