<h1>Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland,</h1>
Disneyland Park, originally Disneyland,
 is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim,
 California, opened on July 17, 1955.
 It is the only theme park designed and 
 built under the direct supervision of Walt Disney.
 . After hiring a consultant to help him determine an appropriate site for his project,
 Disney bought a 160-acre (65 ha) site near Anaheim in 1953.
 Construction began in 1954 and the park was unveiled during 
 a special televised press event on the ABC Television Network on July 17, 1955
